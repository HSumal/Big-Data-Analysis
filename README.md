NOTABLE PROBLEMS AND ANALYSIS:

## HW1:
  - Q2 - Understanding of fundamental statistical and big-data related concepts (Convergence in Probability and Convergence in Distribution)
  - Q4 - Understanding of basic data manipulation and plotting with R
  - Q5 - Analysis of a big data set (3,000,000) from a data website
  - Q6 - Linear Regression on big data set of housing prices in the USA
  - Q7 - An addon to Q6 that performs Feature Engineering on the data-set
  - Q8 - Data Analysis on wine data, predicting what will be the best selling wine in the future, and what parameters are the ones to look for
  - Q9 - Similar predictive data analysis as above but with baseball data.
  
## HW2:
  - Q3 - Understanding of SVM theory
  - Q4 - Big Data Analysis on ad data, as well as designed a Real-Time Bidding (RTB) algorithm that predicts how many clicks an ad-space will generate
       - This questions utilizes many types of advanced regression methods such as Lasso and Ridge logistic regression
  - Q6 - Data Analysis and Machine Learning on pictures, detecting and predicting whether they contain a standing-upright human.
  - Q7 - Big Data Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews, seeing which words attribute to being most associated with good reviews and bad reviews
  - Q8 - Logistic Regression to analyze the most important parameters related to Heart Disease, specifically CHD; a disease that targets blood vessels that supply to the heart.
  
## HW3:
  - Q3 - K-Means Wikipedia Documents Clustering. Analyzed quantile usage of words in the Wikipedia dataset. This dataset mainly consisted of people and their biographies.
  - Q2, Question 4 (K-Means Clustering) - Nationwide GDP Growth Correlation. Cleaned the global GDP data-set and performed lasso regression and various data visualization techniques to understand correlation in GDP growth nationwide. Produced a nodewise graph plot that showed countries who had a Lasso non-zero coefficient correlation between countries A AND B. (Note that we used the AND rule, and as such both A had to have a coefficient associated with B and vice-versa.)
  - Q5 - Modified the proffessors given code to predict the winner of AlphaGO vs. Lee Sedol matches using the data from games 2 and 4.
